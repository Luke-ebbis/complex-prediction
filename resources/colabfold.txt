                       input results

positional arguments:
  input                 One of: 1) directory with FASTA/A3M files, 2) CSV/TSV
                        file, 3) FASTA file or 4) A3M file.
  results               Results output directory.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

MSA arguments:

  --msa-only            Query and store MSAs from the MSA server without
                        structure prediction
  --msa-mode {mmseqs2_uniref_env,mmseqs2_uniref,single_sequence}
                        Databases to use to create the MSA:
                        UniRef30+Environmental (default), UniRef30 only or
                        None. Using an A3M file as input overwrites this
                        option.
  --pair-mode {unpaired,paired,unpaired_paired}
                        Multimer MSA pairing mode for complex prediction:
                        unpaired MSA only, paired MSA only, both (default).
  --pair-strategy {complete,greedy}
                        How sequences are paired during MSA pairing for
                        complex prediction. complete: MSA sequences should
                        only be paired if the same species exists in all MSAs.
                        greedy: MSA sequences should only be paired if the
                        same species exists in at least two MSAs. Typically,
                        greedy produces better predictions as it results in
                        more paired sequences. However, in some cases complete
                        pairing might help, especially if MSAs are already
                        large and can be well paired.
  --templates           Query PDB templates from the MSA server. If this
                        parameter is not set, "--custom-template-path" and "--
                        pdb-hit-file" will not be used. Warning: This can
                        result in the MSA server being queried with A3M input.
  --custom-template-path CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_PATH
                        Directory with PDB files to provide as custom
                        templates to the predictor. No templates will be
                        queried from the MSA server. '--templates' argument is
                        also required to enable this.
  --pdb-hit-file PDB_HIT_FILE
                        Path to a BLAST-m8 formatted PDB hit file
                        corresponding to the input A3M file (e.g. pdb70.m8).
                        Typically, this parameter should be used for a MSA
                        generated by 'colabfold_search'. '--templates'
                        argument is also required to enable this.
  --local-pdb-path LOCAL_PDB_PATH
                        Directory of a local mirror of the PDB mmCIF database
                        (e.g. /path/to/pdb/divided). If provided, PDB files
                        from the directory are used for templates specified by
                        '--pdb-hit-file'.

Prediction arguments:

  --num-recycle NUM_RECYCLE
                        Number of prediction recycles. Increasing recycles can
                        improve the prediction quality but slows down the
                        prediction.
  --recycle-early-stop-tolerance RECYCLE_EARLY_STOP_TOLERANCE
                        Specify convergence criteria. Run recycles until the
                        distance between recycles is within the given
                        tolerance value.
  --num-ensemble NUM_ENSEMBLE
                        Number of ensembles. The trunk of the network is run
                        multiple times with different random choices for the
                        MSA cluster centers. This can result in a better
                        prediction at the cost of longer runtime.
  --num-seeds NUM_SEEDS
                        Number of seeds to try. Will iterate from
                        range(random_seed, random_seed+num_seeds). This can
                        result in a better/different prediction at the cost of
                        longer runtime.
  --random-seed RANDOM_SEED
                        Changing the seed for the random number generator can
                        result in better/different structure predictions.
  --num-models {1,2,3,4,5}
                        Number of models to use for structure prediction.
                        Reducing the number of models speeds up the prediction
                        but results in lower quality.
  --model-type {auto,alphafold2,alphafold2_ptm,alphafold2_multimer_v1,alphafold2_multimer_v2,alphafold2_multimer_v3,deepfold_v1}
                        Predict structure/complex using the given model. Auto
                        will pick "alphafold2_ptm" for structure predictions
                        and "alphafold2_multimer_v3" for complexes. Older
                        versions of the AF2 models are generally worse,
                        however they can sometimes result in better
                        predictions. If the model is not already downloaded,
                        it will be automatically downloaded.
  --model-order MODEL_ORDER
  --use-dropout         Activate dropouts during inference to sample from
                        uncertainty of the models. This can result in
                        different predictions and can be (carefully!) used for
                        conformations sampling.
  --max-seq MAX_SEQ     Number of sequence clusters to use. This can result in
                        different predictions and can be (carefully!) used for
                        conformations sampling.
  --max-extra-seq MAX_EXTRA_SEQ
                        Number of extra sequences to use. This can result in
                        different predictions and can be (carefully!) used for
                        conformations sampling.
  --max-msa MAX_MSA     Defines: `max-seq:max-extra-seq` number of sequences
                        to use in one go. "--max-seq" and "--max-extra-seq"
                        are ignored if this parameter is set.
  --disable-cluster-profile
                        Experimental: For multimer models, disable cluster
                        profiles.
  --data DATA           Path to AlphaFold2 weights directory.

Relaxation arguments:

  --amber               Enable OpenMM/Amber for structure relaxation. Can
                        improve the quality of side-chains at a cost of longer
                        runtime.
  --num-relax NUM_RELAX
                        Specify how many of the top ranked structures to relax
                        using OpenMM/Amber. Typically, relaxing the top-ranked
                        prediction is enough and speeds up the runtime.
  --relax-max-iterations RELAX_MAX_ITERATIONS
                        Maximum number of iterations for the relaxation
                        process. AlphaFold2 sets this to unlimited (0),
                        however, we found that this can lead to very long
                        relaxation times for some inputs.
  --relax-tolerance RELAX_TOLERANCE
                        Tolerance threshold for relaxation convergence.
  --relax-stiffness RELAX_STIFFNESS
                        Stiffness parameter for relaxation.
  --relax-max-outer-iterations RELAX_MAX_OUTER_ITERATIONS
                        Maximum number of outer iterations for the relaxation
                        process.
  --use-gpu-relax       Run OpenMM/Amber on GPU instead of CPU. This can
                        significantly speed up the relaxation runtime,
                        however, might lead to compatibility issues with CUDA.
                        Unsupported on AMD/ROCM and Apple Silicon.

Output arguments:

  --rank {auto,plddt,ptm,iptm,multimer}
                        Choose metric to rank the "--num-models" predicted
                        models.
  --stop-at-score STOP_AT_SCORE
                        Compute models until pLDDT (single chain) or pTM-score
                        (multimer) > threshold is reached. This speeds up
                        prediction by running less models for easier queries.
  --jobname-prefix JOBNAME_PREFIX
                        If set, the jobname will be prefixed with the given
                        string and a running number, instead of the input
                        headers/accession.
  --save-all            Save all raw outputs from model to a pickle file.
                        Useful for downstream use in other models.
  --save-recycles       Save all intermediate predictions at each recycle
                        iteration.
  --save-single-representations
                        Save the single representation embeddings of all
                        models.
  --save-pair-representations
                        Save the pair representation embeddings of all models.
  --overwrite-existing-results
                        Do not recompute results, if a query has already been
                        predicted.
  --zip                 Zip all results into one <jobname>.result.zip and
                        delete the original files.
  --sort-queries-by {none,length,random}
                        Sort input queries by: none, length, random. Sorting
                        by length speeds up prediction as models are
                        recompiled less often.

Advanced arguments:

  --host-url HOST_URL   Which MSA server should be queried. By default, the
                        free public MSA server hosted by the ColabFold team is
                        queried.
  --disable-unified-memory
                        If you are getting TensorFlow/Jax errors, it might
                        help to disable this.
  --recompile-padding RECOMPILE_PADDING
                        Whenever the input length changes, the model needs to
                        be recompiled. We pad sequences by the specified
                        length, so we can e.g., compute sequences from length
                        100 to 110 without recompiling. Individual predictions
                        will become marginally slower due to longer input, but
                        overall performance increases due to not recompiling.
                        Set to 0 to disable.
