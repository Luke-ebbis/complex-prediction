# Complex-prediction

This will be a snakemake pipeline to predict complexes with
[Combfold](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02174-0).

## Usage

This snakemake üêç project is powered by [pixi üöÄ](https://prefix.dev/), it
handles _all_ of the dependencies (@me if it don't!). Installing the pipeline
involves the following steps:

```bash
# Install pixi
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Print the help
pixi install

```

The hardware requirement is a CUDA 11.8 or higher enabled graphics driver. If
this is met, analysis can begin!

```
# Run the whole analysis pipeline from begining to end for all files in `data`
pixi run make
```

Usage in a HPC context is done with the

```
pixi run jobscript
```

command, this will launch a 24 hour long job with 18 cores with 12800 mb of GPU
memory. Then once the job is submitted and working, the `err` log will contain
logs from the snakemake output (such as startup messages etc), and the `out`
log will contain standard output, written by programmes such as `colabfold`.


## Steps in the pipeline

The input data in the form of combfold formatted JSON files from `data` are
copied over to the `results/data` directory. First the structures of the pairs
are calculated using combfold. The best pairs are used to calculate higher order
structures. Following this, the combfold algorithm is used to calculate the
structure of the complex of the pairs and higher order pairs.

The colabfold step is done in paralel for each (higher order) pair. The outputs
of colabfold are captured by re-evaluating the job-graph after the the pairings
have been determined by Combfold.
